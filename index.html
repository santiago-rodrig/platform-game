        <p class="flow-text">Have you ever played a platform game before? I'm 80% sure you had, but in the chance of me being wrong (20%), all that you have to do is
          <strong>
            jump, not fall, and gather points
          </strong>
          (and obviously do not touch the spikes), easy! In this game you'll be running forever, something similar to
          <a href="https://flappybird.io/" target="_blank">
            flappy bird
          </a>
          but not that similar, because you are not a bird. Enough talking, go ahead and play!</p>

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Use <kbd class="grey darken-4 white-text">&uarr;</kbd> to jump, tap the screen if you are using a mobile device.</p>

        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <ol class="collection">
          <li class="collection-item">Jump to avoid falling down (two jumps available when just starting)</li>
          <li class="collection-item">Evade the spikes that appear randomly above platforms</li>
          <li class="collection-item">Collect jewels that also appear randomly above platforms</li>
          <li class="collection-item">Every minute difficulty increases (there are only two more levels of difficulty) and when this happens speed gets augmented, but score and jumps are augmented too!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Game Engine</h2>
        <p>This game was made with
          <a href="http://phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser 3</a>,
          take a look if you feel like it, but in summary it is a JavaScript library for creating games for the browser using, yes, obviously, JavaScript, and it's completely supported by the developers' community.</p>

        <h2>Source Code</h2>
        <p>The

            source code for this project
          </a>
          is open to anyone who wants to take a look or even do some modifications, it's our code (ain't the open source people similar to communists in that aspect?).</p>
